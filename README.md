# 🛫 Pilot Training

This project is a "Pilot Training" application that helps users learn to fly with AI.

## ✈️ Pilot Training Tasks

Ideas to try out for different Copilot-powered development tasks:

- 📝 Create a sign-up form with multiple steps and validation
- 🧠 Create an pilot quiz based on hard-coded questions, with a scoring page (add confetti)
- 🌬️ Show current wind conditions for the user's location
- ✅ Write tests for all those features
- 🤖 Add GitHub Models for some AI magic, which is hard as this app doesn't have a server yet

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/pilot-training.git
    cd pilot-training
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
